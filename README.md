## üìñ The Journey to AI-Enhanced Security Development

Welcome to the Secure Code AI Development Enterprise Workshop! This repository takes you on a transformative journey from traditional reactive security practices to the world of AI-assisted proactive security development and automated threat response.

As a developer in today's threat-laden environment, you face a critical challenge: **most security issues are discovered too late**. According to industry studies:

- Traditional security approaches catch vulnerabilities only after deployment
- Late-stage fixes cost 100x more than early detection
- Manual security reviews create bottlenecks and delays
- Reactive patching instead of proactive prevention

This workshop provides hands-on guidance to implement modern security workflows using AI-powered tools. We'll demonstrate how GitHub Copilot, GitHub Advanced Security, and Microsoft Sentinel can transform your security development strategy.

> *"Security is not about adding gates at the end, but about building resilience from the first line of code with AI-powered intelligence amplifying human expertise."*
